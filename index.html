          **Please consult with your own tax or legal professional to determine
          your individual eligibility. Tax credit amount is based on
          vehicle-specific component sourcing and assembly and may be subject to
          change. You may not claim the credit if (1) your adjusted gross income
          exceeds certain thresholds or (2) the MSRP of the vehicle, as
          configured, exceeds $80,000 (including all optional equipment attached
          to the vehicle at the time of delivery to the dealer, but excluding
          destination charges, optional items added by the dealer, taxes and
          fees). Tax credit may be applied at point of sale, subject to dealer
          availability, or as a potential future tax savings. The amount of your
          tax savings will depend on your individual tax circumstances.
